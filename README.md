SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
A data science capstone project focused on predicting the success of Falcon 9 rocket landing using machine learning and dashboard analytics.

Project Overview

SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, is revolutionizing the space industry through reusable rocket technology. This project predicts the landing success of Falcon 9 rocket boosters, helping SpaceX improve mission planning and reduce operational costs. It includes data collection, EDA, machine learning modeling, and an interactive dashboard for insight discovery.

Problem Statement
  Predicting Falcon 9 booster landing success using historical mission data, to support decision-making in launch planning and reusability analysis.

Landing a booster depends on:
	•	Launch Site
	•	Orbit Type
	•	Payload Mass
	•	Booster Version


Methodology
	1.	Data Collection
	•	SpaceX API
	•	Kaggle datasets
	•	Web scraping (BeautifulSoup)
	2.	Data Wrangling
	•	Cleaned missing values
	•	Encoded categorical variables
	•	Created engineered features
	3.	EDA
	•	Visual insights using Seaborn & SQL
	•	Geo-mapping using Folium
	4.	Modeling
	•	Classification with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN
	•	Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search)
	5.	Dashboard
	•	Built with Plotly Dash for interactive filtering and visualization


Tools & Technologies
	•	Languages: Python, SQL
	•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Folium
	•	Web Tools: Dash, BeautifulSoup, Requests
	•	Data Sources: SpaceX API, Wikipedia, Kaggle


Exploratory Data Analysis

  EDA included:
	  •	Success vs. Launch Site (catplot)
	  • Payload Mass vs. Landing Outcome (scatterplot)
	  •	Orbit Type vs. Success Rate (barplot)
	  •	Yearly Trends in Success Rate
	  •	SQL queries for grouping, filtering, aggregation

Key Insights:
	•	CCAFS SLC 40 and KSC LC 39A showed higher success rates
	•	Payload mass impacts landing success
	•	Missions after 2014 showed consistent improvements


Interactive Mapping

  Folium maps were used to:
	  •	Visualize global launch site locations
	  •	Show success/failure using color-coded markers
	  •	Display proximity to highways, railroads, and coastlines
	  •	Include popups for site info


Dashboard with Plotly Dash

  The interactive dashboard includes:
	  •	Dropdown Selector: Choose launch site
	  •	Slider: Filter by payload mass range
	  •	Pie Chart: Landing success rate per site
	  •	Scatter Plot: Payload vs. Landing Outcome
  
 
 Model Building & Evaluation

  Models Used:
	  •	Logistic Regression
	  •	Decision Tree Classifier (Best performing)
	  •	SVM
	  •	K-Nearest Neighbors

Evaluation:
	•	Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
	•	Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning

Best Model Accuracy: 0.875 (Decision Tree)


Results
	•	Most influential features: Launch Site, Orbit, Payload
	•	High-performing dashboard for data interaction
	•	Steady improvement in landing success over time
	•	Classification accuracy visualized via bar chart
	•	Confusion matrix for the best model included


Conclusion

  This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline from data extraction to model deployment with dashboard interaction. It validates the hypothesis that       launch characteristics significantly affect landing outcomes.
